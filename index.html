    <h1>Use plaintext email</h1>
    <p>
      There are two main types of emails on the internet: plaintext and HTML.
      The former is strongly preferred. This guide is brought to you by
      <a href="https://sourcehut.org">Sourcehut</a>, an online platform for
      software development which utilizes plaintext emails for many features.

    <h2 id="why-plaintext">Why is plaintext better than HTML?</h2>
    <p>
      HTML emails are mainly used for marketing - that is, emails you probably
      don't want to see in the first place. The few advantages they offer for
      end-users, such as links, inline images, and bold or italic text, aren't
      worth the trade-off.
    </p>
    <h3>HTML as a vector for phishing</h3>
    <p>
      HTML emails allow you to make links which hide the URL behind some
      user-friendly text. However, this is an extremely common vector for
      phishing attacks, where a malicious sender makes a misleading link which
      takes you to a different website than you expect. Often these websites are
      modeled after the login page of a service you use, and will trick you into
      entering your account password. In plaintext emails, the URL is always
      visible, and you can more easily make an informed choice to click it.
    </p>
    <h3>Privacy invasion and tracking</h3>
    <p>
      Virtually all HTML emails sent by marketers include identifiers in links
      and inline images which are designed to extract information about you and
      send it back to the sender. Examine the URLs closely - the strange numbers
      and letters are unique to you and used to identify you. This information
      is used to hack your brain, attempting to find advertisements which are
      more likely to influence your buying habits. HTML emails are good for
      marketers and bad for you.
    </p>
    <h3>Mail client vulnerabilities</h3>
    <p>
      HTML is an extremely large and complicated set of specifications designed
      without emails in mind. It's designed for browsing the world wide web, on
      which a huge variety of documents, applications, and more are available.
      Implementing even a reasonable subset of these standards represents
      hundreds of thousands of hours of work, or even millions. A large subset
      (perhaps the majority) of these features are not desirable for emails, and
      if included can be leveraged to leak information about you, your contacts,
      your calendar, other emails in your inbox, and so on. However, because of
      the herculean effort necessary to implement an HTML renderer, no one has
      built one specialized for emails which is guaranteed to be safe. Instead,
      general purpose web browsers, with many of their features disabled, are
      employed in most email clients. This is the number one source of
      vulnerabilities in email clients which result in information disclosure
      and even the execution of arbitrary malicious code.
    </p>
    <h3>HTML emails are less accessible</h3>
    <p>
      Browsing the web is a big challenge for users who require a screenreader
      or other assistive tools to use their computer. The same problems apply to
      email, only more so - making an accessible HTML email is even more
      difficult than making an accessible website due to the limitations imposed
      on HTML emails by most mail clients (which they have no choice but to
      impose - for the security reasons stated above). Plain text emails are
      a breeze in comparison for screenreaders to recite, especially for users
      with specialized email clients designed for this purpose. How do you speak
      bold text aloud? How about your inline image?
    </p>
    <h3>Some clients can't display HTML emails at all</h3>
    <p>
      Some email clients don't support HTML emails at all. Many email clients
      are designed to run in text-only environments, like a terminal emulator,
      where they're useful to people who spend a lot of time working in these
      environments. In a text-only interface it's not possible to render an HTML
      email, and instead the reader will just see a mess of raw HTML text. A lot
      of people simply send HTML emails directly to spam for this reason.
    </p>
    <h3>Rich text isn't that great, anyway</h3>
    <p>
      Rich text features desirable for end users include things like inline
      images, bold or italicized text, and so on. However, the tradeoff isn't
      worth it. Images can simply be attached to your email, and you can employ
      things like *asterisks*, /slashes/, _underscores_, or UPPERCASE for
      emphasis. You can still communicate your point effectively without
      bringing along all of the bad things HTML emails come with.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      In short, HTML emails are a security nightmare, are mostly used for
      advertising to you and tracking you, are less accessible for many users,
      and don't offer anything especially great for it.

    <h2 id="etiquette">Etiquette recommendations for plaintext emails</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to training you that HTML emails are the norm, many harmful
      mail clients may have trained you with other bad habits. Here are some
      tips to unlearn them:
    </p>
    <h3>Top posting</h3>
    <p>
      When you reply to an email, many email clients will include a quoted
      version of the message you're replying to beneath the text of your reply.
      This leads to long email threads containing the entire history of the
      discussion in an increasingly long and nested footer on every email. This
      is called "top posting" and is strongly discouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though some clients would have you believe otherwise, you can edit the
      quoted version of the message you're replying to, and you're encouraged
      to. Feel free to trim it down, cutting out any extra text which isn't
      directly relevant to your reply - or removing it entirely. Write anything
      you have to say underneath the quote it pertains to.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>A</strong>: Because it reverses the logical flow of conversation.</li>
      <li><strong>Q</strong>: Why is top posting frowned upon?</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Wrapping your text</h3>
    <p>
      Email writers are encouraged to wrap their text at 72 columns by inserting
      a newline and resuming your writing on the following line. The
      <a href="#recommended-clients">recommended clients</a> will do this for
      you, as well as any client shown above with "Wraps text or uses
      format=flowed" checked. Don't worry about re-wrapping the quoted parts of
      message you're replying to unless you want to. If your client doesn't do
      this for you, it can easily be the most frustrating part of being a good
      email netizen, but it's very much appreciated by recipients.

    <h2 id="implementation-recommendations">
      Recommendations for software which sends emails
    </h2>
    <p>
      Thanks for your interest in making plaintext emails more accessible to
      your users!
    </p>
    <h3>For senders of automated emails</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you must use HTML, send a
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME"
          rel="noopener nofollow"
        >multipart/alternative</a>
        email with both a plaintext and HTML version included. Your programming
        language probably includes tools for creating these kinds of emails.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For senders of user-authored emails</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Allow users to compose emails in plaintext, and consider making this
        the default. When the user composes a message in plaintext, send a
        text/plain email instead of a multipart/alternative email with a
        generated HTML part.
      </li>
      <li>
        When composing a plaintext email, hard-wrap their lines at 72 columns by
        inserting newlines at the nearest word boundary. Optionally, use
        <a
          href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2646.txt"
          rel="noopener nofollow"
        >format=flowed</a> instead to
        allow plaintext emails to be displayed and composed without hard
        wrapping.
      </li>
      <li>
        When users reply to an email in plaintext, don't encourage top-posting
        by leaving their cursor above the quoted message. Instead, add two
        newlines after the quoted message and leave their cursor there. Allow
        the user to edit the quoted message. Quote each line of the original
        message with &gt; and a single space, followed by the quote.
      </li>
      <li>
        When users send an HTML email explicitly, convert it to text/plain and
        send a multipart/alternative email which includes both versions.
      </li>
      <li>
        When displaying multipart/alternative emails, give the user the option to prefer
        to view the plaintext part by default.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Email clients which meet all of these criteria and prefer plaintext by
      default are entitled to a spot on our recommended clients list.
